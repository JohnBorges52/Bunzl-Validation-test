# Bunzl Customer`s BackOrder Notification System [in development]

### Problem
Sometimes, customers go into the store and cannot find their items due to stock shortage. The current way to handle this is to write the customer's phone and name and give them a call when the item arrives. This project aims to solve this problem by sending them a text message to inform them that their order is ready and an e-mail with the items that are ready.
